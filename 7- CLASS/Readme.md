Review and complete the study cases on DB backup.

## DATABASE RESTORE
A successful restore is equally valuable as a successful backup.
A disaster recovery strategy is never complete without testing a database restore.
Always test your backup by restoring it on a test server or another machine.

## CREATING BACKUP
### Syntax:

```
mysqldump options > backup_filename.sql

```
### EXAMPLE:

```css

mysqldump --user=username --password=password database_name > backup.sql
```

Following our scenario, Pierre receives the backup and needs to restore the database on a server.

### Task:

Restore a single database.
Store it in a new folder.
