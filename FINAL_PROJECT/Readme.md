# Project
The project is a crucial part of this course. To earn a certificate of completion, you need to create, deliver, and present your database project. It should encompass major learning outcomes from the course modules, including core requirements and advanced options.

## Core Requirements
### Your project must meet the following core requirements:

Create a relational database with at least 5 tables.
Set primary and foreign key constraints to establish relations between tables.
Use various types of joins to create logical views.
Create a stored function within your database.
Prepare a sample query with a subquery to extract data for analysis.
Create a DB diagram illustrating table relations.

### Advanced Options
In addition to core requirements, you should include 2-3 requirements from the advanced options list. These options allow you to fine-tune the complexity of your project and provide valuable learning experiences.

### Project Submission and Assessment
Take a backup copy of your database diagram and save it as a projectname.sql file. Submit it via the designated Slack channel before the deadline.
Instructors will review and assess your project, providing feedback and comments.
A copy of your project file, along with assessment results and comments, will be forwarded to the course administrators to issue your certificate.
During week 8, each student will present and demonstrate their project in class, summarizing the project's purpose and functionality.

### Project Presentations
Group projects are allowed; however, you must meet specific requirements.
Each presentation should last approximately 3 minutes.
Start with the database diagram and explain the project's concept, purpose, and expected usage.
Demonstrate how functions, stored procedures, and other elements work within your database.
Showcase sample data stored in tables to provide a comprehensive overview of your project.
